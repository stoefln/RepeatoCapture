7. Fees and Payment
7.1 Fees
Your use of the Services is subject to you paying us the fees applicable to the Services plan selected and/or used by you ("Subscription Fee"). The Subscription Fees, permitted usage, and available features for each Services plan are listed at repeato.app/pricing (the "Pricing").

You will pay all fees in Euros per the payment terms on an Order or otherwise agreed at the time of purchase. The amount of fees payable by you shall vary depending upon the number of Users and the period for which you are authorized to use the Services ("Subscription Term"). Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except the “Trial Period” (see below), fees paid are non-refundable. In making payment, you acknowledge and agree that you are not relying on being able to use the Services beyond the Subscription Term or on the availability of any future enhancements or upgrades. If you fail to pay any fees on time, We reserve the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) suspend or terminate the applicable Services. If you make any purchases through a reseller ("Reseller"), you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your right to Use the Services if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller.

Except as otherwise specified in an Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates set forth in the Pricing) unless you cancel auto-renewal of your subscription through your Account at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term. If you cancel auto-renewal, your subscription will terminate at the end of the current billing cycle, or immediately if you so choose, however you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.

For example, if your monthly subscription period ends on the 15th of every month, and you cancel on the 20th, you’ll continue to have full access until the 15th of the following month, but you won’t be charged again after that.

If your annual subscription period is on the 100th day of the year, and you cancel on the 120th day, you will continue to have full access until the 100th day of the following year, but you won’t be charged again after that.

You may cancel your annually billed plan within the first 30 days from the date of original sign-up or at least 1 day before your annual subscription renewal date. Once you cancel your paid subscription, you won’t be charged again.


7.2. Trial Period
We offer you a money-back guaranty for the first 30 days of use of the product, which compensates users who were not satisfied with the Services. The first day of use starts with the day of order.


7.3 Taxes
Our fees are exclusive of all taxes that are payable in respect of the Services or its Use in the jurisdiction in which the payment is either made or received ("Taxes"). To the extent that any Taxes may be payable, you must pay us the amount of such Taxes in addition to any Subscription Fees owed by you hereunder. Any applicable tax-exempt certificates must be provided to us, who will make reasonable efforts to provide you with such invoicing documents as may enable you to seek an applicable refund or credit for the amount of Taxes so paid from any relevant revenue authority.


7.4 Payment by Credit Card
When you purchase a subscription ("Purchase"), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you the Subscription Fee (at the then-current Pricing) and Taxes, as follows: (i) monthly in advance for monthly plans, (ii) annually in advance for annual plans, and (iii) for additional Users you add during an existing Subscription Term. Subscription Fees are subject to change, although we will notify you in advance of any such change.

We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Purchase, including your credit card number and expiration date, and your billing address (such information, "Payment Information"). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a purchase, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to our third-party service providers so we can complete your Purchase and charge your payment method for the type of Purchase you have selected (plus any Taxes and other applicable charges).


7.5 Authorization for Recurring Payments
By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a subscription, you acknowledge that your subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation or termination of your subscription by you or us. We (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with your Subscription Term (e.g., each month or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription Term, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription Term begins on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started a monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. Your subscription continues until canceled by you or till we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the subscription in accordance with these Terms. You will pay all fees in Euros per the payment terms on an Order or as otherwise agreed at the time of purchase.
